# Determining the edition of the running engine
There is a new global property **the editionType**. This property can be used to determine what edition of the engine is currently running.
It returns *community* if the currently running engine is the LiveCode Community IDE or a standalone built with LiveCode Community.
It returns *commercial* if the currently running engine is the LiveCode Commercial IDE or a standalone built with LiveCode Commercial.
