# Sound recording returns error message

The Quicktime implementation of sound recording has been updated to use the SGAudioMediaType in place of the deprecated SoundMediaType, to fix various errors with sound recording. Moreover a pausing feature has been added to the sound recorder, via the syntax **record pause** and **record resume**.
